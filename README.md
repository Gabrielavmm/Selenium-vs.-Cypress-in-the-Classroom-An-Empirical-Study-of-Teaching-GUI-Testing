# Selenium vs. Cypress in the Classroom: An Empirical Study of Teaching GUI Testing


---

## Overview
This repository contains the replication package for a longitudinal classroom study conducted over multiple semesters to compare Cypress and Selenium as introductory frameworks for GUI test automation in an undergraduate software quality course.

The study explores how the selected testing framework affects both the quality of the GUI test suites produced by students and the learning experience of novice testers. Throughout five academic semesters, 98 student pairs implemented automated GUI tests for the same web application using both frameworks under equivalent instructional settings.

The replication package provides the datasets, experimental materials, and analysis scripts used to assess the generated test suites through a static analysis pipeline that evaluates test conformance, locator robustness, and the presence of test smells. It also includes questionnaire responses collected to capture students' perceptions regarding usability, debugging, synchronization mechanisms, development challenges, and overall learning experience.

By integrating quantitative analyses of the test artifacts with qualitative feedback from students, the study offers empirical insights into the strengths and limitations of Cypress and Selenium, helping educators and researchers make more informed decisions when selecting GUI testing frameworks for introductory software testing and software quality courses.

### Research Questions

- **RQ1:** How do Cypress and Selenium test suites written by undergraduate students compare in terms of quality?
- **RQ2:** How do students perceive the development experience and challenges of using Cypress and Selenium?

## Study Design

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Course | Software Verification and Validation (undergraduate, CS program) |
| Participants | 98 pairs across 5 semesters (2023–2025) |
| Frameworks | Cypress and Selenium WebDriver |
| System Under Test | [Sylius](https://sylius.com/) — open-source eCommerce platform |
| Data collection | Test suite submissions + perception questionnaire |
| Analysis | AST-based static analysis + ESLint + content analysis of open-ended responses |

Each pair developed two test suites — one in Cypress, one in Selenium — targeting a specific Sylius feature. Minimum requirements: ≥ 10 test cases per suite, ≥ 4 GUI interactions per test case, ≥ 1 assertion per test case.

Students received a starter kit with a preconfigured Docker container and one reference test case for each framework (Cypress and Selenium). The examples targeted the assigned administrative-panel section and were included in the submissions.

## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. AST-based analysis (`scripts/ast-analysis/`)
Parses each test file into an Abstract Syntax Tree to extract:

- test_case_count  
- assertion_conformity  
- interaction_conformity  
- avg_assertions  
- total_locators  
- fragile_locator_rate  
- locator breakdown  
- smell_hard_coded  

---

### 2. ESLint (`scripts/eslint-config/`)
Detects test smells such as:

- fixed waits  
- unsafe chains  
- await loops  
- `.only()` usage  
- unused variables  
- max lines per function  
- max statements  

---

### 3. Statistical analysis (`scripts/statistical-analysis/`)
Applies the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test to validate differences between Cypress and Selenium across all metric groups: Group 1 (test_case_count, assertion_conformity, interaction_conformity), Group 2 (fragile_locator_rate, avg_assertions), and Group 3 (test smells). Reports W statistic, p-value, and rank-biserial effect size r overall and per semester.
