# Selenium vs. Cypress in the Classroom: A Multi-Semester Case Study on GUI Test Quality and Student Experience


---

## Overview

This repository provides the replication package for an empirical study conducted in the context of an undergraduate Software Verification and Validation course. The study investigates the use of Cypress and Selenium as introductory frameworks for teaching and practicing GUI test automation.

Over five academic semesters, 98 pairs of students developed GUI test suites for the same web application using both frameworks under comparable instructional and experimental conditions. The replication package includes the materials and data used to analyze the test artifacts produced by the students, as well as questionnaire responses collected to understand their perceptions during the development process.

The study combines static analysis of student-generated test suites with self-reported experience data to examine how each framework supports novice testers in producing GUI tests and how students perceive the learning process, usability, and challenges associated with Cypress and Selenium. Rather than focusing only on tool performance, the study aims to understand the educational implications of adopting these frameworks in software testing courses.
### Research Questions

- **RQ1:** How do Cypress and Selenium test suites written by undergraduate students compare in terms of quality?
- **RQ2:** How do students perceive the development experience and challenges of using Cypress and Selenium?

## Study Design

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Course | Software Verification and Validation (undergraduate, CS program) |
| Participants | 98 pairs across 5 semesters (2023–2025) |
| Frameworks | Cypress and Selenium WebDriver |
| System Under Test | [Sylius](https://sylius.com/) — open-source eCommerce platform |
| Data collection | Test suite submissions + perception questionnaire |
| Analysis | AST-based static analysis + ESLint + content analysis of open-ended responses |

Each pair developed two test suites — one in Cypress, one in Selenium — targeting a specific Sylius feature. Minimum requirements: ≥ 10 test cases per suite, ≥ 4 GUI interactions per test case, ≥ 1 assertion per test case.

Students received a starter kit with a preconfigured Docker container and one reference test case for each framework (Cypress and Selenium). The examples targeted the assigned administrative-panel section and were included in the submissions.

## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. AST-based analysis (`scripts/ast-analysis/`)
Parses each test file into an Abstract Syntax Tree to extract:

- test_case_count  
- assertion_conformity  
- interaction_conformity  
- avg_assertions  
- total_locators  
- fragile_locator_rate  
- locator breakdown  
- smell_hard_coded  

---

### 2. ESLint (`scripts/eslint-config/`)
Detects test smells such as:

- fixed waits  
- unsafe chains  
- await loops  
- `.only()` usage  
- unused variables  
- max lines per function  
- max statements  

---

### 3. Statistical analysis (`scripts/statistical-analysis/`)
Applies the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test to validate differences between Cypress and Selenium across all metric groups: Group 1 (test_case_count, assertion_conformity, interaction_conformity), Group 2 (fragile_locator_rate, avg_assertions), and Group 3 (test smells). Reports W statistic, p-value, and rank-biserial effect size r overall and per semester.
